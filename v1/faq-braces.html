   <h4> Frequently Asked Questions on Braces </h4>

      <b>It is common to see people having dental Braces these days. Does everyoone need them? Why do they have to wear Braces?</b><br/>
      People wear braces for a variety of reasons. The most common reason for orthodontic treatment with braces is to straighten out crooked
      teeth. Sometimes, teeth protrusion is another reason for treatment too. Other problems requiring treatment include spaced out teeth,
      missing teeth, improper bites and jaw disharmonies. Young children may occasionally have problems with tooth eruption, which may
      necessitate early orthodontic treatment.<br/><br/><br/>
    </div>

  <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <b>When is a good time to start Braces?</b><br/>
        In the majority of people who have crooked teeth but normal jaw growth, treatment can commence when most of the permanent teeth are out.
        This usually occurs around the age of 11 to 13 years. However, there are some instances when early intervention is needed. Some children
        have developing jaw disharmonies where the jaws may be growing abnormally. Some have problems with permanent tooth eruption, either due to
        lack of space or misdirection of the teeth. In these situations, early braces treatment is required to assist with the growth of the jaws or
        help guide teeth into their respective positions. . This can take place anytime from 7 to 11 years of age. Very often, these problems go
        unnoticed, which is why the American Association of Orthodontists recommends that children should see an orthodontist from 7 years of age.<br/><br/><br/>

          <b>Are Braces only for Teenagers? Am I too old for Braces?</b><br/>
          Orthodontic treatment is usually done during the teenage years. This is a good age as tooth movement is more efficient in younger patients.
          In addition, there are some growth potential remaining in adolescents, which may be beneficial during the course of treatment. Having
          said that, adults can benefit from braces too. There are no age limit for braces because teeth can continue to be straightened in
          adulthood.<br/><br/><br/>

          <b>I want to straighten my teeth but I feel conscious wearing traditional metal Braces. Are there other options available? </b><br/>
          As more adults seek orthodontic treatment, the request for less visible, hidden or invisible braces have increased. Fortunately, there
          are braces available to not only suit the adult wearer’s request for a less visible or invisible treatment experience, these braces
          satisfy their functional purpose as well as traditional metal braces. <br/><br/> Ceramic braces, made of tooth-coloured ceramic brackets
          which are less visible at a glance, is a common solution to eradicating patients’ concerns to having their braces showing. Up close, a thin
          metal wire can sometimes be seen threading through the braces. <br/><br/> Invisible braces treatment is another aesthetic option for
          people who wish to straighten their teeth but desire a natural appearance. This system of braces consist of numerous clear plastic
          aligners that are worn over the teeth. Each of these aligners is custom made and progressively moves teeth into their desired positions.
          The aligners are barely seen when worn over the teeth due to the transparency and clarity of the material used. These braces are
          convenient and hygienic as patients can remove the aligners during mealtimes and whilst cleaning their teeth.<br/><br/><br/>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>I have heard that retainers need to be worn after Braces treatment. Why is that so? </b><br/>
          Upon completion of orthodontic treatment, the teeth are slightly unstable in their new positions. Teeth that have been moved have a
          tendency to return to their original positions due to the nature of the surrounding gum tissue. In order to minimise this tendency,
          retainers are usually worn over the teeth to maintain their corrected positions. In the initial period, they are worn throughout the
          day, only to be taken out when eating and brushing. When the teeth positions stabilise after a few months, the retainers may then be
          worn only at night.<br/><br/><br/>
