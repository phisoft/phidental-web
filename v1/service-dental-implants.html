      <b>Dental Implants</b><br/>
      Implant dentistry is a specialised field for the replacement of missing teeth. This is done with
      titanium fixtures placed in the jawbone. These fixtures are used to support missing teeth.<br/>
      Dentists will place the titanium fixtures and some time is necessary for the bone to heal completely around these fixtures, after which
      crowns can be placed via intermediate abutments.<br/>
The use of specialised computer software and digital 3-dimensional x-ray facility has allowed our dentists to plan and perform implant
surgeries in a virtual space. This serves to prepare our dentists during the performance of the actual surgery and hence improves the safety
and predictability of implant treatment. Specialised laboratory equipment and trained technicians are available to ensure a precise fit and the
quality of your new teeth.<br/><br/><br/>

          <b>Benefits of Dental Implants</b><br/>
          <ul>
            <li>Improve chewing efficiency<br/>
              Dental implants allow for the application of higher bite force when compared to dentures. Hence, patients with implants can chew
              with better efficiency. This will translate to food tasting better.</li>
              <li>No pain from dentures<br/>
                 Loose and ill-fitting dentures can cause ulcers and cuts into the gum tissue. Using implants, the denture can be secured and
                 hence, prevents such painful daily experience.</li>
              <li>Anti-aging effect<br/>
                  The loss of teeth leads to a “sunken-in” appearance, which is typically associated with aging. When patients replace their
                  teeth, these teeth will support the lips and cheeks that results in a more desirable appearance.</li>
              <li>Better health through better diet<br/>
                  Compromises in chewing efficiency will affect the choice of food in our daily diet. When chewing efficiency is affected,
                  patients tend to favour soft food, which is high in sugar and fat content and avoid fibrous or tougher food, higher in protein
                  and vitamins. Replacing teeth with dental implants will enable patients to have a more balanced diet through improvement in
                  chewing efficiency.</li>
              <li>Improve self-esteem and confidence<br/>
                  Missing teeth or loose dentures can negatively impact our patients’ self-esteem and confidence. Patient with such problems
                  tend to avoid smiling, speaking or engaging in social activities. However, with adequate replacement of teeth, patients can
                  then confidently speak and smile without the fear of denture dropping midway through a conversation.</li>

      <b>Treatment Procedures</b><br/>
      <ol>
        <li>First Consultation<br/>
          Relevant x-rays will be taken and comprehensive examination will be performed by our dentists.
          Our dentist will then discuss your pre-existing dental condition and treatment required to save your natural teeth.
          Discussion of treatment plan for implants includes information on the duration of treatment, phases of treatment,
          implant brands and materials used, cost and as well as the maintenance protocol.</li>
          <li>Placement of Implants<br/>
              Dentists will gently insert a titanium implant under local anaesthesia.
              Once the implant is placed, the implant site is allowed to heal for 2 months. During this time, the jawbone is allowed to heal
              around the implant. Temporary restoration may be placed during this phase for aesthetic and functional reasons.</li>
          <li>Placement of new teeth<br/>
              After osseointegration of the titanium implants to bone, dentists will take a mould of your implants.
              Each crown is custom-made by our  technician. The crown is made to match to the neighbouring teeth as much as possible in order
              to achieve a good esthetic outcome</li>
          <li>Care for your implants<br/>
              Implants are like our natural teeth and need to be cleaned daily. They also need to be checked regularly and be cleaned by dentists.
              Professional cleaning of implants is done with special instruments; otherwise the implant surface will be damaged.</li>
          <li>Surgery duration<br/>
              In most cases, implant surgeries can be completed in 30 minutes. However, adequate time should be given for the patient to have
              all his/her questions answered. Also, time should also be allowed for the patient to be prepared for the surgery in an unhurried
              fashion.</li>
          <li>Is the surgery painful?<br/>
              Most implant surgeries are pain-free. In fact, almost 90% of our patients do not need painkillers beyond the second day. However, we would recommend that the patient takes the prescribed painkillers on the first day.</li>

          <b>Cost of Dental Implants</b><br/>
          The cost of implant treatment is dependent on the following factors.
          <ul>
            <li>Experience and skill level of the dentist</li>
            <li>The brand and reliability of implant used</li>
            <li>The type of material used to fabricate the teeth</li>
            <li>Whether additional adjunct procedures are required</li>
          </ul>
          We encourage you to speak with our professionals to find out more about the dental implant treatments available for your condition, dental implant costs, price ranges and other fees applicable.<br/><br/><br/>
