      <b>Dental Braces</b><br/>
      Dental braces are orthodontic appliances designed to straighten and improve the aesthetics and function of your teeth. This benefits
      children as straight teeth are easier to clean. In addition, after the teeth have been straightened, there is usually an increase in
      overall self-esteem and confidence level. If your child is from age 6 to 10, you can consider Myobrace to correct the growth and
      development of his/her teeth.<br/>
The braces process can be uncomfortable when the teeth are being moved. Braces can also trap more food than usual, so great attention to good
oral hygiene is required to prevent tooth decay and gum disease. The common types of braces include the traditional metal braces, ceramic
braces and self-ligating braces. For aesthetics reasons, there are also invisible or clear braces (a more commonly known brand is Invisalign)
options, you can read more about <a style="color:#09729e" href="service-invisalign.html">Invisalign</a> here.<br/><br/><br/>

          <b>Type of Braces</b><br/>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Metal Braces</b><br/>
              Metal braces are the most common and affordable type of braces. These braces are made of high-grade stainless steel. Metal braces
              are attached to the teeth and are not removable by the patient. There are also wires that are held onto the braces with colourful
              rubber bands. Metal braces are most popular with teenagers who like to decorate their teeth and braces with colours. However, the
              braces have a certain thickness and patients usually take a week or two to get used to the braces in the mouth.</li>
              <li><b>Metal Braces</b><br/>
                Ceramic braces are made from tooth-coloured materials that blend in naturally with the colour of teeth. These braces are more
                aesthetically pleasing when compared to metal braces; making it a popular choice for patients who want some form of aesthetic
                and less visible braces. The ceramic material used in the braces are stain resistant and do not discolour easily. However, like
                metal braces these ceramic braces also have a certain thickness that takes some getting used to.</li>
              <li><b>Self-Ligating Braces</b><br/>
                Self-ligating braces are slightly different from the conventional metal or ceramic braces described earlier. These braces are
                also attached onto the teeth; however, the wires are held onto the braces using a “gate” that is built into the braces, hence
                the term self-ligating. This reduces the need for rubber bands and thus there is less friction in the whole braces system. This
                allows for lighter forces to be used on the teeth, and often translates to more comfortable treatment. </li>
              <li><b>Invisible Braces</b><br/>
                Invisible braces are suitable for patients who have the desire to solve their orthodontics concerns but are conscious of the
                stigma that the wearing of visible braces presents. The aligners are made of transparent and pliable material. They provide a
                discreet, natural appearance, and when worn there is a significant decrease in discomfort then those present in traditional
                braces. The aligners are removable to allow for the convenient cleaning of teeth and comfortable consumption of food. However,
                because these aligners are removable, patients have to be consistent and disciplined with the compliance of their treatment
                plans.</li>

          <b>Cost of Braces (Orthodontic) Treatment</b><br/>
          The price of orthodontic treatment varies according to each patient’s needs. As each individual is unique, there will be differing
          goals of treatment depending on the presenting clinical situation. Our clinicians will advise you on the most suitable type of braces
          treatment. The cost of treatment will be discussed once all the information required is established.<br/><br/><br/>
