      <b>Wisdom Tooth</b><br/>
      A wisdom tooth is also known as the third molar. In general, wisdom teeth will grow out of the gums between the ages of 18 to 21. If the 
      wisdom tooth erupts straight out, they do not need to be removed. However, these wisdom teeth does not always grow out as desired.<br/>
When they do not erupt properly, wisdom teeth can cause pain and infection. This is when the removal of these wisdom teeth becomes necessary. 
The procedure can be performed by specialists to ensure that the removal is safe and painless.<br/><br/><br/>

  <b>Wisdom Tooth Surgery</b><br/>
  A wisdom tooth surgery is a procedure whereby the dentist performs a minor but delicate surgical procedure to safely remove a wisdom tooth 
  that has not erupted as desired.<br/>
  Wisdom tooth surgeries are usually done under local anaesthesia. Research has shown that wisdom tooth surgery is a very safe and
  straight-forward procedure. With proper examination and x-rays analysis, dentists will be able to predictably and safely perform wisdom tooth 
  surgical procedures. The x-rays helps the dentist to plan for a successful surgery and to note on details like the positioning of your wisdom 
  tooth and how close the root is growing to the nerve that runs in the lower jaw. This is important as the compression of the nerve will cause 
  the patient to experience some numbness to the lower lip.<br/>
  There are some common discomfort that the patient will experience in the initial days after the surgery. Mild pain, bleeding and swelling 
  lasting one of two days will be experienced, however, painkillers and other medication will be prescribed to aid with pain management and 
  healing.<br/><br/><br/>

          <b>Benefits of Wisdom Tooth Removal</b><br/>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Saving of teeth</b><br/>
              When wisdom teeth do not grow out straight, food trap will occur between the wisdom tooth and its adjacent tooth. The food trapped 
              results in decay and gum disease which affect the wisdom teeth and its neighbouring teeth.<br/>Early removal of the wisdom tooth 
              can prevent the loss of your initial molars.</li>
              <li><b>Prevention of pain and swelling</b><br/>
                Food trap between the wisdom tooth and its adjacent tooth can lead to infection. With infection, patients often experience 
                severe pain and swelling. More serious problems such as the formulation of cysts or tumours around an impacted tooth can occur. 
                This leads to the destruction of the surrounding jawbone, tissues and neighbouring teeth, leading to prolonged, costly treatments. 
                If such serious conditions are not addressed, the infection could eventually become so severe that it becomes life threatening.</li>
              <li><b>Elimination of bad breath</b><br/>
                Patients often complain of bad breath due to the build-up of food and bacteria between wisdom tooth and its adjacent tooth or 
                under the gums covering the wisdom tooth. Sometimes, people surrounding the patient can detect the rancid smell that emits from 
                the patentâ€™s mouth. When this occurs, the removal of the wisdom tooth causing the odour should do the job. </li> 
              <li><b>Prevention of cyst formation</b><br/>
                Wisdom teeth that failed to grow out can lead to formation of cyst. In rare but serious development, these cysts can become cancerous. 
                Hence, removal of wisdom tooth is indicated for these reasons.</li>    <br/>
