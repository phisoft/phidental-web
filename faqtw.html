      <b>Are there any side-effects associated with Teeth Whitening?</b><br/>
      Teeth whitening is an extremely safe and straightforward procedure. The most common side effect experienced is sensitivity, the intensity 
      varies from patient to patient. Teeth whitening will not affect the integrity of the tooth structure and existing fillings; however, 
      existing fillings, veneers or crowns present in the front teeth are unlikely to lighten to the same degree as natural teeth and may need to 
      be changed accordingly.<br/><br/><br/>

  <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <b>Is Teeth Whitening safe for Pregnant and nursing mothers?</b><br/>
        Teeth whitening is generally perceived to be a safe procedure for pregnant of nursing mothers. This is because the active ingredient in 
        whitening gel, Peroxide, breaks down in water and releases oxygen radicals, which penetrates the tooth and whitens it, and does not affect
        any other parts of the body. There are also no studies to indicate that teeth whitening poses any risks to a developing foetus, but, as the 
        first trimester is a crucial period for the development of the foetus, we generally recommend caution.<br/> 
        It is also completely safe for new mothers to use whitening gels whilst still nursing.

        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>Is Teeth Whitening suitable for young children?</b><br/>
          Caution is generally advised when carrying out whitening procedures on children. This is because their permanent teeth may not yet be 
          fully developed.<br/><br/><br/>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>What are the side effects of using whitening gel or undergoing the high-intensity light treatment?   </b><br/>
          Before teeth whitening gel is applied, a patient's lips and gums will be protected. This means that, other than short term tooth sensitivity, 
          there are generally no other side effects experienced.<br/><br/><br/>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>Will my teeth become more brittle after the teeth whitening treatments?</b><br/>
          Teeth whitening does not affect the integrity of teeth, therefore it will not lead to the teeth becoming brittle.<br/><br/><br/>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>Are there any situations whereby I would be unsuitable for the in-office whitening procedure?</b><br/>
          Every patient is different, for example, abnormalities in the development and structure may result in innate weakness of the natural 
          teeth. For this reason, we advise that patients undergo an individual consultation before committing to any dental procedure.<br/><br/><br/>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>Do I have to give up drinking coffee if I wish to keep my teeth white after the procedures?</b><br/>
          We do not advocate that patients forgo coffee in order to maintain white teeth. Our dentists will advise you on various ways to 
          maintain your new smile; generally regular professional cleaning and use of the maintenance trays will help remove any superficial 
          stains, including nicotine stains caused by smoking.<br/><br/><br/>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>How white should my teeth be? How can I determine the ideal level of whiteness for my teeth?</b><br/>
          The ideal level of whiteness varies between individuals. Our dental surgeons will be able to advise on individual cases.<br/><br/><br/>
        </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>If I wear the tray with whitening gel for several hours a day, instead of 1 hour per day, can I achieve whitening at home in a shorter period of time than 14 days?</b><br/>
          As a general rule of thumb we advise against over-using the whitening tray and gel, which would include prolonged usage in a single 
          day. We do this because we are following the protocol recommended by the manufacturers.<br/><br/><br/>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>I have tried teeth whitening toothpaste and teeth whitening kits and these have not helped me at all. How do I know that the in-office or home whitening treatments will be effective?</b><br/>
          The main difference between store bought products and professionally dispensed products is in the mode of application and 
          concentration of the whitening gels used. Professionally dispensed gels are of a higher concentration and thus, deliver a more 
          predictable and noticeable result.<br/><br/><br/>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>My teeth are discoloured due to tetracycline. Can these procedures remove the stains?</b><br/>
          We expect some degree of whitening to occur, even on tetracycline stained teeth. However, depending on severity of the stains, it may 
          not be possible to remove all of the stains.<br/><br/><br/>

        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>What about hygiene standards at Phi Dental Centre?</b><br/>
          We understand the concern and importance placed on personal safety. Phi Dental Centre uses autoclave sterilisation and 
          disposable/non-contamination techniques to ensure that the highest hygiene standards are met.<br/><br/><br/>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>Does this procedure hurt?</b><br/>
          Most patients experience no discomfort. However, some do experience mild temporary pain.<br/><br/><br/>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <b>How much does this procedure cost?</b><br/>
          At Phi Dental Centre our approach is to customise treatment for each individual. The cost will very much depend on the specific 
          patientâ€™s programme. We believe that, by doing this, we are able to ensure maximum value for patients as they are charged only for 
          the treatment they need and not for general dental packages. This will eliminate any treatment or services not needed.<br/><br/><br/>
