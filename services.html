              <p>Dental braces are orthodontic appliances designed to straighten and improve the aesthetics and function of your teeth. This benefits children as straight teeth are easier to clean. In addition, after the teeth have been straightened, there is usually an increase in overall self-esteem and confidence level. If your child is from age 6 to 10, you can consider Myobrace to correct the growth and development of his/her teeth.
                The braces process can be uncomfortable when the teeth are being moved. Braces can also trap more food than usual, so great attention to good oral hygiene is required to prevent tooth decay and gum disease. The common types of braces include the traditional metal braces, ceramic braces and self-ligating braces. For aesthetics reasons, there are also invisible or clear braces (a more commonly known brand is Invisalign) options. </p>
              <p><strong>Flexible Payment Arrangements with no hidden charges</strong></p>
              <p>We promise to deliver the highest possible level of quality care to our patients and aim to provide you with the best value for your investment in our services. Our prices reflect the whole package which includes all x-rays, follow-up consultations, impressions, retainers and braces for both upper and lower arches. There are simply no hidden charges. The option to break down the payment into progressive payments is also available for our patients who are more comfortable with partial payment plans.</p>

            <b>Type of Braces</b>
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Metal Braces</b>
                <br>
                Metal braces are the most common and affordable type of braces. These braces are made of high-grade stainless steel. Metal braces are attached to the teeth and are not removable by the patient. There are also wires that are held onto the braces with colourful rubber bands. Metal braces are most popular with teenagers who like to decorate their teeth and braces with colours. However, the braces have a certain thickness and patients usually take a week or two to get used to the braces in the mouth.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Ceramic Braces</b>
                <br>
                Ceramic braces are made from tooth-coloured materials that blend in naturally with the colour of teeth. These braces are more aesthetically pleasing when compared to metal braces; making it a popular choice for patients who want some form of aesthetic and less visible braces. The ceramic material used in the braces are stain resistant and do not discolour easily. However, like metal braces these ceramic braces also have a certain thickness that takes some getting used to.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Self-Ligating Braces</b>
                <br>
                Self-ligating braces are slightly different from the conventional metal or ceramic braces described earlier. These braces are also attached onto the teeth; however, the wires are held onto the braces using a “gate” that is built into the braces, hence the term self-ligating. This reduces the need for rubber bands and thus there is less friction in the whole braces system. This allows for lighter forces to be used on the teeth, and often translates to more comfortable treatment. 
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Invisible Braces</b>
                <br>
                Invisible braces are suitable for patients who have the desire to solve their orthodontics concerns but are conscious of the stigma that the wearing of visible braces presents. The aligners are made of transparent and pliable material. They provide a discreet, natural appearance, and when worn there is a significant decrease in discomfort then those present in traditional braces. The aligners are removable to allow for the convenient cleaning of teeth and comfortable consumption of food. However, because these aligners are removable, patients have to be consistent and disciplined with the compliance of their treatment plans.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Cost of Braces (Orthodontic) Treatment</strong></p>
              <p>The price of orthodontic treatment varies according to each patient’s needs. As each individual is unique, there will be differing goals of treatment depending on the presenting clinical situation. Our clinicians will advise you on the most suitable type of braces treatment. The cost of treatment will be discussed once all the information required is established.</p>

              <p>With the loss of multiple teeth and as the aging process sets in, you may experience not only the loss of the ability to chew, you will lose the confidence to smile too. Further loss of facial muscle support and tone may cause your face to look ‘saggy’ and old. Speech may also be affect due to spaces formed in the gaps of missing teeth especially if they are in front.
                Dentures can restore all these problems for you. Often used together with implant therapy, Dentures users today can enjoy their food, smile and laugh confidently without fear of them breaking or coming loose.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Benefits of Dentures</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Helps to restore any unsightly gaps in your smile.</li>

                <li>Dentures usually require several visits.</li>
                <li>Our dentists need to make detailed measurements of your teeth, gums and jaw, especially if used in combination with implants. This is to ensure that your dentures are well-fitted, secure and comfortable.</li>

              <h1 class="department-title"></i>Dental Implant</h1>
              <p>Implant dentistry is a specialised field for the replacement of missing teeth. This is done with titanium fixtures placed in the jawbone. These fixtures are used to support missing teeth.
                 Dentists will place the titanium fixtures and some time is necessary for the bone to heal completely around these fixtures, after which crowns can be placed via intermediate abutments.
                 The use of specialised computer software and digital 3-dimensional x-ray facility has allowed our dentists to plan and perform implant surgeries in a virtual space. This serves to prepare our dentists during the performance of the actual surgery and hence improves the safety and predictability of implant treatment. Specialised laboratory equipment and trained technicians are available to ensure a precise fit and the quality of your new teeth.</p>


              <p><strong>Benefits of Dentures</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Improve chewing efficiency</strong></li>
                  Dental implants allow for the application of higher bite force when compared to dentures. Hence, patients with implants can chew with better efficiency. This will translate to food tasting better.

                  <li><strong>No pain from dentures</strong></li>
                  Loose and ill-fitting dentures can cause ulcers and cuts into the gum tissue. Using implants, the denture can be secured and hence, prevents such painful daily experience.


                  <li><strong>Anti-aging effect</strong></li>
                  The loss of teeth leads to a “sunken-in” appearance, which is typically associated with aging. When patients replace their teeth, these teeth will support the lips and cheeks that results in a more desirable appearance.


                  <li><strong> health through better diet</strong></li>
                  Compromises in chewing efficiency will affect the choice of food in our daily diet. When chewing efficiency is affected, patients tend to favour soft food, which is high in sugar and fat content and avoid fibrous or tougher food, higher in protein and vitamins. Replacing teeth with dental implants will enable patients to have a more balanced diet through improvement in chewing efficiency.

                  <li><strong>Improve self-esteem and confidence</strong></li>
                  Missing teeth or loose dentures can negatively impact our patients’ self-esteem and confidence. Patient with such problems tend to avoid smiling, speaking or engaging in social activities. However, with adequate replacement of teeth, patients can then confidently speak and smile without the fear of denture dropping midway through a conversation.

                </ul>

                <p><strong>Treatment Procedures</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>First Consultation</strong></li>
                  Relevant x-rays will be taken and comprehensive examination will be performed by our dentists. Our dentist will then discuss your pre-existing dental condition and treatment required to save your natural teeth. Discussion of treatment plan for implants includes information on the duration of treatment, phases of treatment, implant brands and materials used, cost and as well as the maintenance protocol.

                  <li><strong>Placement of Implants</strong></li>
                  Dentists will gently insert a titanium implant under local anaesthesia. Once the implant is placed, the implant site is allowed to heal for 2 months. During this time, the jawbone is allowed to heal around the implant. Temporary restoration may be placed during this phase for aesthetic and functional reasons.


                  <li><strong>Placement of new teeth</strong></li>
                  After osseointegration of the titanium implants to bone, dentists will take a mould of your implants. Each crown is custom-made by our technician. The crown is made to match to the neighbouring teeth as much as possible in order to achieve a good esthetic outcome


                  <li><strong>Care for your implants</strong></li>
                  Implants are like our natural teeth and need to be cleaned daily. They also need to be checked regularly and be cleaned by dentists. Professional cleaning of implants is done with special instruments; otherwise the implant surface will be damaged.

                  <li><strong>Surgery duration</strong></li>
                  In most cases, implant surgeries can be completed in 30 minutes. However, adequate time should be given for the patient to have all his/her questions answered. Also, time should also be allowed for the patient to be prepared for the surgery in an unhurried fashion.

                  <li><strong>Is the surgery painful?</strong></li>
                  Most implant surgeries are pain-free. In fact, almost 90% of our patients do not need painkillers beyond the second day. However, we would recommend that the patient takes the prescribed painkillers on the first day.

                </ol>

                <p><strong>Benefits of Dentures</strong></p>
                <p>The cost of implant treatment is dependent on the following factors.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Experience and skill level of the dentist</li>

                  <li>The brand and reliability of implant used</li>

                  <li>The type of material used to fabricate the teet</li>

                  <li>Whether additional adjunct procedures are required</li>
                </ul>

              <p><strong>What is invisible Invisalign?</strong></p>
              <p>Invisible Braces / Invisalign are transparent and removable orthodontic appliances for straightening teeth. It uses a series of nearly invisible and removable aligners that are custom-made specifically for your set of teeth.
                 The braces are barely visible when worn over the teeth due to the transparency and clarity of the material used. The aligners will gradually straighten your teeth until you achieve your desired result at the end of your treatment.
                 To ensure that your treatment is optimal, it is advisable to wear the invisible braces / Invisalign at least 17 hours a day.</p>

                 <p><strong>Benefits of Invisible Invisalign</strong></p>
                 <ul>

                  <li><strong>The Initial Consultation</strong></li>
                  It is important to meet up with your dentist for a consultation to find out if you are suitable for the treatment and to find out more. This is when you can ask questions like: Am I suitable? How much will my treatment cost? How long will it take?

                  <li><strong>Taking Records For Your Case</strong></li>
                  Before your dentist can plan your Invisible Braces / Invisalign treatment, they will need to take photographs, dental impressions and X-rays. These will be used to analyse your dental condition.

                  <li><strong>Treatment Plan</strong></li>
                  A personalised treatment plan will be created and the dentist will explain to you how long your treatment will take to achieve the desired result.

              <h1 class="department-title"></i>Root Canal Treatment</h1>
              <p>Root canal treatment is a procedure, which eliminates infection that has reached the nerves of the affected tooth. Signs of infection requiring root canal treatment include pain, prolonged sensitivity to hot or cold, tenderness to chewing, swelling of the gum and the discolouration of the tooth.
                During root canal treatment, the infected nerves are removed and the inside of the tooth is disinfected and cleaned. It is then filled and sealed with a rubber-like material called gutta-percha. The tooth is then restored with a crown or permanent filling for protection. After the final restorations, the tooth continues to function like any other tooth.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Benefits of Root Canal Treatment</strong></p>
              Root canal treatment eliminates pain from a badly infected tooth which otherwise has to be extracted. Saving the natural tooth will help maintain chewing efficiency and protect the other teeth from excessive wear or stress. It also helps maintain your natural smile.
            
              <p><strong>Treatment Procedures</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>A thorough examination is done and an x-ray of the tooth is taken.</li>
                  <li>Local anaesthetic is administered. A 'dental dam' is placed over the tooth to keep it clean and free of saliva during the procedure.</li>
                  <li>An opening is made in the crown of the tooth and small instruments are used to clean out the infected pulp tissue and shape the root canal space for filling.</li>
                  <li>The prepared root canal is filled with a biocompatible material and sealed to prevent bacteria from re-entering the canal.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Cost of Root Canal Treatment</strong></p>
                The cost varies depending on the tooth that is being treated and complexity of the problem. Molars have multiple root canals which are more difficult to treat. As such, the cost is usually higher.
                We encourage that you to speak with our dentist during your consultation to find out more about the dental treatment available for your condition, price ranges and other fees applicable.

              <h1 class="department-title"></i>Scalling And Polishing</h1>
              <p>Dental scaling and polishing should be done regularly because bacteria in the oral cavity constantly forms around your teeth and gums in a film known as plaque. This layer of plaque eventually absorbs minerals in the saliva to form hardened deposits known commonly as calculus or tartar. When left untreated, the bacteria will eventually cause a host of common dental problems such as dental cavities in your teeth and gum problems.</p>

              <p><strong>Benefits of Scaling and Polishing</strong></p>
              Scaling and polishing removes the bacterial deposits that constantly form around your teeth and gums. Regular oral hygiene maintenance is essential in preventing common dental problems such as dental cavities and gum problems. It also ensures cleaner and brighter looking teeth.

                <li>Examination and assessment of dental condition.</li>
                <li>Scaling with gentle ultrasonic to remove calculus. This is done with dental loupes which magnify the vision, enabling the scaling process to be done in a precise and gentle manner.</li>
                <li>Flossing and polishing to remove plaque.</li>

            <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="teethwhitening">
              <h1 class="department-title"></i>Teeth Whitening</h1>
              <p>Teeth whitening is the least invasive of all dental cosmetic treatments. It is safe, fast and inexpensive; an effective way to brighten natural teeth discoloured or stained by age or chemical. Most patients can expect to brighten their teeth by 8 to 10 shades after the whitening procedure.
                While safe, some individuals do experience some degree of transient tooth sensitivity; this can however be managed by your dentist.</p>

              <p><strong>Benefits of Teeth Whitening</strong></p>  
              Do you have stained teeth from too much coffee/tea or smoking? Or you may be born with naturally discoloured teeth (intrinsic stains)? Teeth whitening is frequently used to treat mild to moderate surface and intrinsic stains.
              After 2-3 weeks of ‘home’ whitening or 1 hour of ‘In-office’ whitening, you will be able to achieve your sparkling dream smile. However, longer whitening periods will be required for more severe discolourations (like Tetracycline stains).

              <p><strong>Maintenance</strong></p>
              This is important to ensure many years of enjoyment of your new smile.
              As part of PHI Dental’s whitening protocol, we recommend that all our patients maintain the brightness of their teeth regularly with their customized home-whitening trays. These customised home-whitening trays are crafted in our in-house dental laboratory to ensure excellent fit, greater comfort and satisfaction among our patients. While safe, some individuals do experience some degree of transient tooth sensitivity; this can however be managed by your dentist.

              <h1 class="department-title"></i>Wisdom Tooth Surgery</h1>
              <p><strong>Wisdom Tooth</strong></p>
              A wisdom tooth is also known as the third molar. In general, wisdom teeth will grow out of the gums between the ages of 18 to 21. If the wisdom tooth erupts straight out, they do not need to be removed. However, these wisdom teeth does not always grow out as desired. When they do not erupt properly, wisdom teeth can cause pain and infection. This is when the removal of these wisdom teeth becomes necessary. The procedure can be performed by specialists to ensure that the removal is safe and painless.
              <br><br>

              <p><strong>Wisdom Tooth Surgery</strong></p>
              A wisdom tooth surgery is a procedure whereby the dentist performs a minor but delicate surgical procedure to safely remove a wisdom tooth that has not erupted as desired.
              Wisdom tooth surgeries are usually done under local anaesthesia. Research has shown that wisdom tooth surgery is a very safe and straight-forward procedure. With proper examination and x-rays analysis, dentists will be able to predictably and safely perform wisdom tooth surgical procedures. The x-rays helps the dentist to plan for a successful surgery and to note on details like the positioning of your wisdom tooth and how close the root is growing to the nerve that runs in the lower jaw. This is important as the compression of the nerve will cause the patient to experience some numbness to the lower lip.
              There are some common discomfort that the patient will experience in the initial days after the surgery. Mild pain, bleeding and swelling lasting one of two days will be experienced, however, painkillers and other medication will be prescribed to aid with pain management and healing.
              <br><br>

              <p><strong>Benefits of Wisdom Tooth Removal</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Saving of teeth</strong></li>
                  When wisdom teeth do not grow out straight, food trap will occur between the wisdom tooth and its adjacent tooth. The food trapped results in decay and gum disease which affect the wisdom teeth and its neighbouring teeth.
                  Early removal of the wisdom tooth can prevent the loss of your initial molars.

                  <li><strong>Prevention of pain and swelling</strong></li>
                  Food trap between the wisdom tooth and its adjacent tooth can lead to infection. With infection, patients often experience severe pain and swelling. More serious problems such as the formulation of cysts or tumours around an impacted tooth can occur. This leads to the destruction of the surrounding jawbone, tissues and neighbouring teeth, leading to prolonged, costly treatments. If such serious conditions are not addressed, the infection could eventually become so severe that it becomes life threatening.

                  <li><strong>Elimination of bad breath</strong></li>
                  Patients often complain of bad breath due to the build-up of food and bacteria between wisdom tooth and its adjacent tooth or under the gums covering the wisdom tooth. Sometimes, people surrounding the patient can detect the rancid smell that emits from the patent’s mouth. When this occurs, the removal of the wisdom tooth causing the odour should do the job. 

                  <li><strong>Prevention of cyst formation</strong></li>
                  Wisdom teeth that failed to grow out can lead to formation of cyst. In rare but serious development, these cysts can become cancerous. Hence, removal of wisdom tooth is indicated for these reasons. 
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Treatment Procedures</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Is wisdom tooth surgery painful? </strong></li>
                    Wisdom tooth surgery is pain-free. Local anaesthesia is given prior to the surgical procedure.

                    <li><strong>How long is wisdom tooth surgery? </strong></li>
                    <br>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Most wisdom tooth sururgery can be completed in 45minutes to one hour.</li>
                        <li>Most of the time is used to prepare the patient; such as ensuring that the patient has pain-free injections and is relaxed before the surgery.</li>
                        <li>Depending on your oral condition and the number of wisdom teeth you will be extracting, your dentist will be able to advise you on the duration only after a thorough initial examination.</li>
                      </ol><br>

                    <li><strong>How long is the recovery period after wisdom tooth surgery? </strong></li>
                        <ol>
                          <li>In general, patients will be able to eat normally after 1-2 days.</li>
                          <li>Patients might experience mild pain for the first day but it can be easily and effectively controlled with painkillers.</li>
                          <li>Bleeding usually stops after one day.</li>
                          <li>Most patients are able to resume normal activities after one or two days.</li>
                        </ol>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Cost of Wisdom Tooth Surgery</strong></p>
                  The cost of wisdom tooth removal will depend on the procedure a patient undergoes. This is why an initial consultation and x-rays are required to determine if you will require an extraction or a surgery. Your dentist will be the best person to advise you on the dental treatments available for your condition, price range and other fees applicable.
